# Food-Inspector-AI-ML-Project
Nowadays most of the cities have hundreds of restaurants, so food inspection has become a necessity. like in our country India, where the population is high and the number of restaurants is also high, so manual food inspection is very random and inefficient so many places which are very unhygienic are left over and a lot of people consume that unhygienic food. So instead of manual inspection, many people post their reviews on different social websites like Zomato, swiggy, Justdial and based on those reviews, we can focus on the restaurants which are tagged as unhygienic in the reviews. So, sir our main target is to develop a model which will gather data from these social websites and will narrow down our search. Our algorithm will detect words, phrases, and different such patterns or features to help make the restaurants as unhygienic and also help the food inspection department to focus on these restaurants.
